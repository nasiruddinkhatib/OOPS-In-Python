Objects Oriented Programming in Python
The History of Object-Oriented Programming
While learning Object-Oriented Programming (oops concepts), I decided to dive into its history to fully know what is oops concept and it turned out to be fascinating. The term “Object-Oriented Programming” (OOP), also known as OOPs principles in python, was coined by Alan Kay around 1966 while he was at grad school. The language called Simula was the first programming language with the features of Object-oriented programming. It was developed in 1967 for making simulation programs, in which the most important information was called objects.

Though OOPs were in the market since the early 1960s it was in the 1990s that OOPs began to grow because of C++. After that, this technique was adopted by various programmers across various programming languages, including Python. Today its application is in almost every field, such as Real-time systems, machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Data Science, expert systems, Client-server systems, Object-oriented databases, and many more.

What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in python?
In Python, OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and classes to create programs. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object, and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program. Main principles of OOPs in Python are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Abstraction refers to the ability to hide the implementation details of an object from the user, while still providing a simple and easy-to-use interface. Encapsulation refers to the practice of combining data and methods within a class to protect the data from external interference. Inheritance is a way to create new classes based on existing ones, allowing the new classes to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class. Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes as if they were of the same class. Consequently, you can write generic code that works with a variety of objects.

By using OOPs concepts in Python, developers can create programs that are more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. OOPs makes it possible to write code that is reusable and scalable, reducing the overall development time and increasing code efficiency.

Example of OOPs
For example, a car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object, its properties would be its color, model, price, brand, etc. And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, and gear change.

Another example – If we consider a dog as an object then its properties would be its color, breed, name, weight, etc., and its behavior/function would be walking, barking, playing, etc.

Object-Oriented Programming is famous because it implements real-world entities like objects, hiding, inheritance, etc, in programming. It makes visualization easier because it is close to real-world scenarios.
