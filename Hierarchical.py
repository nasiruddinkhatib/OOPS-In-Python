#One 1 Parent Class Multiple Child Class and its inherits from parent class
#Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
# ðŸ“Œ Key Characteristics:
# One parent class is shared by multiple child classes.
# Each child class can have its own unique methods and attributes.
# This promotes code reusability by
# allowing all child classes to share common attributes and methods from the parent class.
