# Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance in a single program.
# It can include single, multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical inheritance, depending on the complexity of the class relationships.
# meaning it gets access to all methods from its parent classes.
#ðŸ“Œ Key Characteristics of Hybrid Inheritance:
# âœ” Combines different types of inheritance into one structure.
# âœ” Provides maximum code reusability.
# âœ” Can become complex, so method resolution order (MRO) is important.

# Parent class
class Vehicle:
    def show_vehicle(self):
        print("This is a vehicle.")

# First Child class (inherits from Vehicle)
class Car(Vehicle):
    def show_car(self):
        print("This is a car.")

# Second Child class (inherits from Vehicle)
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def show_bike(self):
        print("This is a bike.")

# Grandchild class (inherits from both Car and Bike - Multiple Inheritance)
class Hybrid(Car, Bike):
    def show_hybrid(self):
        print("This is a hybrid vehicle, which can be both a car and a bike.")

h1 = Hybrid()

h1.show_vehicle()  # âœ… Inherited from Vehicle
h1.show_car()      # âœ… Inherited from Car
h1.show_bike()     # âœ… Inherited from Bike
h1.show_hybrid()   # âœ… Defined in Hybrid

#Output
#This is a vehicle.
# This is a car.
# This is a bike.
# This is a hybrid vehicle, which can be both a car and a bike.

# Output:
# Employee Name: Nasiruddin
# Nasiruddin is a Manager.
# Nasiruddin is a Developer.
# Nasiruddin is a Team Lead, managing projects and coding.
